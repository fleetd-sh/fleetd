  Usage Examples

  # Install p7zip first (for DietPi's 7z format)
  brew install p7zip  # macOS
  # or
  sudo apt-get install p7zip-full  # Linux

  # Provision DietPi with k3s server
  fleetp -device /dev/disk2 -device-type dietpi \
    -wifi-ssid "MyNetwork" -wifi-pass "password" \
    -ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
    -plugin k3s -plugin-opt k3s.role=server

  # Provision Raspberry Pi OS
  fleetp -device /dev/disk2 -device-type rpi \
    -wifi-ssid "MyNetwork" -wifi-pass "password" \
    -ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

  # Dry-run to test without writing
  fleetp -device /dev/disk2 -device-type dietpi \
    -wifi-ssid "MyNetwork" -wifi-pass "password" \
    -dry-run -v

  The system will:
  1. Download the OS image (cached for future use)
  2. Write it to the SD card
  3. Mount partitions
  4. Configure network, SSH, and fleetd
  5. Add k3s installation if requested
  6. Unmount and complete

  After provisioning, insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and it will automatically:
  - Connect to WiFi
  - Install fleetd agent
  - Install k3s (if configured)
  - Register with fleet server via mDNS
